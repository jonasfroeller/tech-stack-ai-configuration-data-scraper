    title: "ReadMeAI: An AI-powered README Generator for Developers",
    content: `This post was written in collaboration with Docker AI/ML Hackathon participants Gitanshu Sankhla and Vijay Barma.
    In this AI/ML Hackathon post, we’ll share another interesting winning project from last year’s Docker AI/ML Hackathon.
    This time, we will dive into ReadMeAI, one of the honorable mention winners.
    For many developers, planning and writing code is the most enjoyable part of the process.
    It’s where creativity meets logic, and lines of code transform into solutions.
    Although some developers find writing documentation equally fulfilling, crafting clear and concise code instructions isn’t for everyone.
    Imagine you’re a developer working on a complex project with a team.
    You just pushed your final commit with a sign of relief, but the clock is ticking on your deadline.
    You know that clear documentation is crucial.
    Your teammates need to understand your code’s intricacies for smooth integration, but writing all that documentation feels like another project entirely,
    stealing your precious time from bug fixes and testing. That’s where ReadMeAI, an AI-powered README generator fits in.`,

            The AI integration is handled by the \controllers/app.js\ file (as shown below), specifically in the postApp function.
            The uploaded code and user description are passed to the AI integration, which uses the Google Palm API to generate a Markdown README.
